# Sarm1_SchwannCell
This code supports the analysis of single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from wild-type (WT) and Sarm1 knockout (KO) sciatic nerves following transection injury. Samples include sham, 2 hours post-injury, and 1 day post-injury time points.

The code was developed for the manuscript currently under revision:
Sarm1 Gates the Transition from Protective to Repair Schwann Cell States Following Nerve Injury
